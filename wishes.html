        <h3>The Golden Reset</h3>
        <p>Fifty is not the weight of years but the lightness of freedom — the reset where wisdom and choice meet. Like the Ganga that renews itself while flowing endlessly, this stage of life offers you the chance to let go of what no longer serves and embrace the streams that truly nourish your spirit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish-card">
        <h3>Discipline, Now as Liberation</h3>
        <p>Your recent victories in Manobod and Dasbod exams are not just results, they are milestones of persistence — reminders that discipline, when rooted in purpose, becomes liberation. As the Bhagavad Gita says: *“Yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam” — true yoga is skill in action.* You have carried this truth in your journey, and it will only deepen as you step into this new chapter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish-card">
        <h3>The Season of Choice</h3>
        <p>Every life has turning points; the fiftieth year is a rare one, offering clarity sharper than youth and energy steadier than old age. It is like standing at the peak of a mountain — where you can see all paths below and choose with intention. This is the time to place your interests, your learnings, and your joy at the center, knowing the family and world around you will only grow richer when you do.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish-card">
        <h3>A Blessing for the Journey Ahead</h3>
        <p>May the years ahead be guided by courage to choose, patience to persist, and joy to savor. We celebrate not just your 50 years of devotion and strength, but the infinite possibilities waiting for you. As Rumi said, *“Try to accept the changing seasons of your heart, even if you have never heard them before.”* Let this birthday be that acceptance, that opening. Here’s to new beginnings — your reset, your renaissance, your radiant path forward.</p>
